Objective Definition:
Clearly define the objectives of the project. What insights are you hoping to gain from the data? Are you looking to analyze pricing trends, popularity of certain brands or models, customer reviews, or any other specific aspects of smartphone sales?

Data Collection (Web Scraping):
Utilize web scraping techniques to extract relevant data from the leading mobile selling website. This could include information such as smartphone brand, model, price, specifications, customer ratings, reviews, etc. Tools like BeautifulSoup in Python can be used for web scraping.

Data Cleaning:
Clean the scraped data to remove any inconsistencies, errors, or missing values. This involves tasks such as handling duplicates, correcting typos, standardizing formats, and dealing with null values.

Data Preprocessing:
Preprocess the data to make it suitable for analysis. This may involve tasks such as converting categorical variables into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding), scaling numerical features, and handling outliers.

Data Enrichment:
Augment the dataset with additional information if necessary. This could include integrating data from other sources, such as market trends, customer demographics, or competitor analysis, to provide more context and insights.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conduct EDA to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. This involves using statistical and visualization techniques to explore the data from different angles. Key aspects to explore may include:

Distribution of smartphone prices
Market share of different smartphone brands
Features that correlate with higher customer ratings
Seasonal trends in smartphone sales
Customer sentiment analysis based on reviews
Correlation between specifications (e.g., camera quality, battery life) and price
Insights Generation:
Based on the findings from EDA, derive actionable insights that can inform decision-making. These insights could be related to pricing strategies, marketing campaigns, product development, or any other aspect of the smartphone business.
